# Kyle's React Spotify App

## App Description

This project is a music app that interacts with the Spotify API to allow the end user
to search for a music artist and display that specified artist's albums and related artists.
Clicking on an album will take you to a page to view the album details of the selected album or
clicking on a related artist will take you to that related artist's albums and also display related
artists of the selected artist.

### Getting Started

***Please start with getting the back end server setup first before this front end located at https://github.com/kyledavis109/React-Express. You will need the back end server up and running before you can launch the front end. The back end also includes documentation on setting up a Spotify Developer account and obtaining a Client ID and a Client Secret.***

To get started you will need to install Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
You will also need a code editor such as Visual Studio Code to view the files (https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Next you will need to install Git to pull the code from my repository (https://git-scm.com/downloads). You will also need to have a GitHub account and repository initialized aswell as a SSH Key, which can be found in the settings of your GitHub account under the SSH and GPG Keys section in the left hand side bar. Once you have installed everything and are setup, you are ready to clone the repository. To clone the repository, run the command in your Git Bash terminal `git clone https://github.com/kyledavis109/React-Music-Project.git` to clone the repository into a folder on your computer. This is only the front end of the application and you will need to also clone the back end of this app from my repository at the address https://github.com/kyledavis109/React-Express. Clone the back end repository into a seperate folder from the front end repository. A README will also be included in that repository to get you started.

You will need a few npm packages installed to run this app. Open your command terminal and cd into the folder that you cloned the repository into. Run `npm i react` to install React (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react). Next, run `npm i react-dom` to install the React Dom (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom). After instaling those, run `npm i react-router-dom` to install the React Router Dom to use the React Router (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). You are now ready to run the app. You will first need to initialize the backend server and get it running to run this app. The repository for the back end server for this project can be found at https://github.com/kyledavis109/React-Express and documentation is available there to guide you through getting the server up and running. Once the back end server is up and running run the command `npm start` in the command terminal to launch the app.
