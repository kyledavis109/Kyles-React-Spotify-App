# Kyle's React Spotify App

  

## About

This project is a music app that interacts with the Spotify API to allow the end user to search for a music artist and display that specified artist's albums and related artists. Clicking on an album will take you to a page to view the album details of the selected album or clicking on a related artist will take you to that related artist's albums and also display related artists of the selected artist.
