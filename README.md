# Kyle's React Spotify App

## About

This project is a music app that interacts with the Spotify API to allow the end user to search for a music artist and display that specified artist's albums and related artists. Clicking on an album will take you to a page to view the album details of the selected album or clicking on a related artist will take you to that related artist's albums and also display related artists of the selected artist.

### Getting Started

***Please start with getting the API setup first before this frontend application located [here](https://github.com/kyledavis109/Spotify-App-Express). You will need the API up and running before you can launch the frontend application. The API also includes documentation on setting up a Spotify Developer account and obtaining a Client ID and a Client Secret.***
